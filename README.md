Data Analysis and Methodology
The analysis involves several key steps:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and structuring the data for analysis, which includes handling missing values, categorizing variables, and ensuring data integrity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting an initial exploration to understand the demographics of the survey respondents.
This includes analyzing the distribution of variables such as age, income, education, sex, and region.

Statistical Modeling: Building predictive models to assess the impact of various factors on voting behavior. Two main models are used:

Logistic Regression: To estimate the likelihood of voting in favor of or against extending the presidency based on demographic factors.
Decision Tree: To provide a graphical representation of the decision-making process and to identify key variables influencing voting behavior.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC).
This step includes a detailed analysis on both training and test datasets to ensure the robustness of the models.

Insights and Conclusions: Drawing insights from the models to understand the key determinants of voting behavior in the referendum.
The analysis provides a nuanced view of how different demographic segments reacted to the political context of the time.

Results
The project successfully identifies critical factors that influenced the voting decisions during the 1988 Chilean referendum. 
Through meticulous data analysis and modeling, it offers a data-driven perspective on historical political events.
